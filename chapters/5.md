# Monero Core and Community

## Monero Community 

If we go back to the Monero history, we'll see how Community is very important for its development. Remember? Originally the anonymous founder of the BitMonero cryptocurrency developed without asking a solid feedback then he made some mistakes and the community of BitMonero decided to fork it and renamed as the Monero cryptocurrency.

Community is everything for Monero: it's the Monero power. Each month there are two Monero-community meetings where everyone can follow the progresses about Monero Community. Originally the community was composed by few people, the Monero fans.

But in the latest months the community grew a lot: over 150,000 users on social networks!

There have been 330 people who have contributed code, with 140 in the past year. The organization scheme of the project has been described as “un-governance”.

The “ungovernance” model, as implemented by Monero, is comprised of four different aspects or “branches”: the Monero Research Group, the community, the Monero Workgroups and the Monero Core. 

The Monero Research Group is an open group of academics and researchers. The community performs functions like posting on the subreddit, helping out newcomers, providing feedbacks, and building out the ecosystem. 
The Monero Workgroups are special Workgroups created with a unique goal: joining people for the same tasks. 
For example there is Monero Hardware Workgroup that has the mission to build the first community-driven Hardware Wallet. Another example could be the Monero Integrations Workgroup that has the mission to build free and open source payment gateways.

Last but not least is the Monero Core Team which is the team who manages critical tasks for Monero. The responsibilities of the Core Team are as follows:

* Act as primary trusted arbiters of the Forum Funding System on behalf of the community, so as to ensure the completion of all projects to the satisfaction of the community.
* Manage the codebase of the Monero Project, which includes merging code on Github, keeping backups, and ensuring the safety, security, and free access of the code from any party.
* Steward the general donation fund, and spending the Monero there on anything they see fit to further the Monero Project.
* Act as trusted signers and distributors of reference clients for the Monero coin, and other related technologies.
* Set a vision for the Monero Project

## Monero Core

Repository of Monero on Github:

* monero The Core of Monero Network, written in C++ language
* monero-gui GUI for Monero, build with Qt library
* monero-site The website for Monero
* sekura The Community Hardware wallet
* kovri The Kovri I2P Router Project 

Over 200 contributors in the past year have contributed to Monero codebase (that includes the Monero “core”) and over 500 users have created their little Monero related project.
