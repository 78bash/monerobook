# Preface

## Writing the Mastering Monero Book
I have always been worried about my privacy; it's pretty well-known that big tech companies track every online action we make. From payments to Amazon all the way to the things we like to research, Big
Brother knows everything about you. They could use your data in order to manipulate what you think, what you like and dislike.
On 16 January 2016, my adventure into the world of cryptocurrency started with Bitcoin. However, I never liked Bitcoin; its blockchain is too public to achieve my goal of having privacy everywhere.
Everybody can see the amount of your transactions which means everyone can look up the amount in your Bitcoin wallets. This means everybody knows if you are rich or not. This can lead to unwanted
circumstances. For example, somebody can increase or decrease the prices based on your wallet.

In May 2017, my friend introduced me to Monero. What? Monero? I thought Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency. Monero: a beautiful world where nobody can see your transactions, protecting the
sender, the receiver, and your wallet value. Privacy is implemented by default.
During my first year on Monero Community, I discovered a lot of
users weren't able to find a global resource in order to know the
Monero deep. Then I started to think about a book that could help
the principiants, but the developer too.


## Who the author is
I am Nico as known as serhack, an Italian contributor to the project
Monero.
I joined the Monero community in May of 2017.
In order to develop Monero Integrations that are payment gateways
between the main e-shop and Monero blockchain, Monero
community funded my crowdfunding campaign: that's amazing: I had
economical and moral support from community. The goal of Monero
is privacy, and I applied this idea to Monero Integrations: you don't
have to sign up for any services, you just need a Monero wallet.
During the development, I understood that there isn't a global
resource that can help developers in order to improve Monero and
integrate it to services such as exchanges and pools.
Then I started to think about an ebook (available as a book too) for
Monero community. The first chapters should be for everyone that
wants to understand what Monero is and why it's so important. The
later chapters are for the developers looking to build and contribute
to the Monero Project.

## Who should read this book

## How this resource is organized

This book is organized roughly in line with the dependencies between
the different topics covered. In particular, cryptocurrency, privacy and
Monero are arguments discussed on the book.
We begin with the first chapter that show us a problem of actual
economical system and how it's resolved with the blockchain.
However a problem still remains. Privacy can't be guaranteed. Here
it's Monero, we will know what is and why we should use it. This will
be helpful and useful for newbies and for users that sometimes
forgot the Monero principles.
In the second chapter we will start to go into the "pratical" part of
Monero: we will understand the different types of existing wallets,
how to create one with Monero GUI and how we can get our first
Monero.
We will explore how Monero works in the third chapter. We will know
what the Monero Team developed for guaranteeing a solid and a
privacy enabled by default. It's a general view about the Monero
Infrastructure, methods.
The fourth chapter is for any users that want to help the community
in order to translate, build or improve Monero in any way. No worries
about how we can help, the important is doing that! We will join to
the Monero community!
The fifth chapter includes an "hot" topic - argument: the mining
process as known as confirming transactions for some users. We'll
see what it's and why it's important in order to guarantee a solid and
trustable system for our transactions.
After five chapters of introduction based on getting started, mining,
building and how Monero works we will go into the Monero deep.
This chapter includes a lot of technical details about Monero ,
expecially Cryptography details. Stealth address, Ring Transactions
and Ring Confidential Transactions won't have secrets for you since
you'll know everything about Monero tecniques. For developers and
experts only, the sixth chapter will be the techinical explaination of
the CryptoNote Protocol. If you can't understand any of the
arguments included in this chapter , we won't be worried; This book is
called Mastering Monero for a reason.
In the seventh chapter, we will see the Monero network and a sub
Monero project Kovri, an open source C++ I2P implementation. We'll
know why it's important and why it's being developed. You will be an
expert about Nodes and P2P protocol.
When we read the book, we'll think about some ideas for Monero. If
Monero is a so helpful cryptocurrency, how I can integrate Monero to
my service? The eigth chapter will provide you all the answers. From
the JSON RPC to the OpenAlias sub project , everyone could start
accepting Monero.
