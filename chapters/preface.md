# Preface

## Writing the Mastering Monero Book I have always been worried about my privacy; it's pretty well-known that big tech companies track every online action we make. From payments to Amazon all the way to the things we like to research, Big Brother knows everything about you. They could use your data in order to manipulate what you think, what you like and dislike.

On 16 January 2016, my adventure into the world of cryptocurrency started with Bitcoin. However, I never liked Bitcoin; its blockchain is too public to achieve my goal of having privacy everywhere. Everybody can see the amount of your transactions which means everyone can look up the amount in your Bitcoin wallets. This means everybody knows if you are rich or not. This can lead to unwanted circumstances. For example, somebody can increase or decrease the prices based on your wallet.

In May 2017, my friend introduced me to Monero. What? Monero? I thought Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency. Monero: a beautiful world where nobody can see your transactions, protecting the sender, the receiver, and your wallet value. Privacy is implemented by default. During my first year on Monero Community, I discovered a lot of users weren't able to find a global resource in order to know the Monero deep. Then I started to think about a book that could help the participants, but the developer too.

 ## Who the author is I am Nico as known as serhack, an Italian contributor to the project Monero. I joined the Monero community in May of 2017. In order to develop Monero Integrations that are payment gateways between the main e-shop and Monero blockchain, Monero community funded my crowdfunding campaign: that's amazing: I had economical and moral support from community. 

The goal of Monero is privacy, and I applied this idea to Monero Integrations; you don't have to sign up for any services, you just need a Monero wallet. During the development, I understood that there isn't a global resource that can help developers in order to improve Monero and integrate it to services such as exchanges and pools. Then I started to think about an ebook (also available as a physical book) for Monero community.

## Who Should Read This Book

## How this resource is organized

This book is organized roughly in line with the dependencies between the different topics covered. In particular, cryptocurrency, privacy and Monero are arguments discussed on the book.

We begin with the first chapter that will show us the problem with the mainstream economic system and how it's resolved with the blockchain. However a problem still remains: Privacy can't be guaranteed. With Monero, we will know what is and why we should use it. This will be helpful and useful for newbies and for users that sometimes forgot the Monero principles.

In the second chapter we will start to go into the "practical" part of Monero: we will understand the different types of existing wallets, how to create one with Monero GUI and how we can get our first Monero.

We will explore how Monero works in the third chapter. We will know what the Monero Team developed for guaranteeing a solid and a privacy enabled by default. It's a general view about the Monero Infrastructure, methods.

The fourth chapter is for any users that want to help the community in order to translate, build or improve Monero in any way. No worries about how we can help, the important is doing that! We will join to the Monero community!

The fifth chapter includes a "hot" topic - argument: the mining process which is confirming transactions for other users. We'll see what it's and why it's important in order to guarantee a solid and trustable system for our transactions.

After five chapters of introduction based on getting started, mining, building, and learning how Monero works we will go into Monero more deeply. This chapter includes a lot of technical details about Monero, especially Cryptography details. Stealth address, Ring Transactions and Ring Confidential Transactions won't have secrets for you since you'll know everything about Monero techniques. For developers and experts only, the sixth chapter will be the technical explanation of the CryptoNote Protocol. If you can't understand any of the arguments included in this chapter, we won't be worried; this book is called Mastering Monero for a reason.

In the seventh chapter, we will see the Monero network and a sub Monero project Kovri, an open source C++ I2P implementation. We'll know why it's important and why it's being developed. You will be an expert about Nodes and P2P protocol.

When we read the book, we'll think about some ideas for Monero. If Monero is a so helpful cryptocurrency, how I can integrate Monero to my service? The eighth chapter will provide you all the answers for this question. From the JSON RPC to the OpenAlias sub project, everyone could start accepting Monero.
