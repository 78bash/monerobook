## Writing the Mastering Monero Book 
I am Nico (“SerHack”),  an Italian security researcher,  a Monero contribuitor, and the publisher of this book.  Finding good resources and learning about cryptocurrencies can be a daunting task, especially when important information is not organized or easy to find. 

For new users, it can be especially challenging to track down documentation written at an understandable technical level. When I first started learning about Monero, I had to spend a great deal of time seeking out and evaluating many different resources on the topic. 

The community decided to write Mastering Monero to guide you along this journey, whether you’re setting up your first wallet or curious about the ‘under the hood’ technical details. The first few chapters are written for anybody curious about why and how to use Monero; they contain easy-to-understand explanations and examples, alongside instructions for practical use. Later chapters progress into more advanced topics, compiling information for developers who wish to build and contribute to the Monero project.

My adventure into the world of cryptocurrencies began when I learned about Bitcoin in January 2016.
From the beginning, I have been concerned about the ramifications of its transparent public ledger. Since Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies are built around openly-linked addresses and coins with clear histories, transactions often inadvertently expose users’ personal financial details. Every address balance is public information, which allows anybody to research your income, spending habits, and amount of cryptocurrency wealth. This can lead to undesirable consequences, such as price manipulation based on wallet balance.

	I thought that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency until a friend introduced me to Monero in May 2017. I was blown away by its beautiful new paradigm: a world where vulnerable details such as account balances and transaction amounts are kept confidential to protect both the sender and the receiver. With privacy features implemented by default and always required, the entire Monero blockchain is veiled and users do not even have the option to accidentally send revealing transactions.

Recognizing the importance of this project, I began looking for ways to contribute to the community. I quickly saw an opportunity to support mass  adoption by building payment gateways for online businesses, so I spearheaded the Monero Integrations project. This open-source codebase is designed around Monero’s privacy-centric mentality: no signup or third-party service is required, since funds are routed directly to the recipient’s wallet. The Monero community was very supportive throughout this endeavor, and the entire enterprise was crowdfunded by donations through the Monero Forum Funding System (FFS). 

	While working on the Monero Integrations project, I learned that the lack of a comprehensive guide to Monero is an obstacle for both end users and the developers seeking to improve Monero and implement integration with services such as exchanges and mining pools. This need for a thorough guide inspired me to write Mastering Monero as a universal resource for our global community. I am grateful for the generous FFS support that has made it possible to publish this document as a free eBook (and physical book!) for the general public. Whether you read Mastering Monero cover-to-cover or jump through sections pertinent to your questions, I hope you enjoy learning about Monero and the exciting projects within the community.


## How this resource is organized

This book is organized roughly in line with the dependencies between the different topics covered. In particular, cryptocurrency, privacy and Monero are arguments discussed on the book.

We begin with the first chapter that will show us the problem with the mainstream economic system and how it's resolved with the blockchain. However a problem still remains: Privacy can't be guaranteed. With Monero, we will know what is and why we should use it. This will be helpful and useful for newbies and for users that sometimes forgot the Monero principles.

In the second chapter we will start to go into the "practical" part of Monero: we will understand the different types of existing wallets, how to create one with Monero GUI and how we can get our first Monero.

We will explore how Monero works in the third chapter. We will know what the Monero Team developed for guaranteeing a solid and a privacy enabled by default. It's a general view about the Monero Infrastructure, methods.

The fourth chapter is for any users that want to help the community in order to translate, build or improve Monero in any way. No worries about how we can help, the important is doing that! We will join to the Monero community!

The fifth chapter includes a "hot" topic - argument: the mining process which is confirming transactions for other users. We'll see what it's and why it's important in order to guarantee a solid and trustable system for our transactions.

After five chapters of introduction based on getting started, mining, building, and learning how Monero works we will go into Monero more deeply. This chapter includes a lot of technical details about Monero, especially Cryptography details. Stealth address, Ring Transactions and Ring Confidential Transactions won't have secrets for you since you'll know everything about Monero techniques. For developers and experts only, the sixth chapter will be the technical explanation of the CryptoNote Protocol. If you can't understand any of the arguments included in this chapter, we won't be worried; this book is called Mastering Monero for a reason.

In the seventh chapter, we will see the Monero network and a sub Monero project Kovri, an open source C++ I2P implementation. We'll know why it's important and why it's being developed. You will be an expert about Nodes and P2P protocol.

When we read the book, we'll think about some ideas for Monero. If Monero is a so helpful cryptocurrency, how I can integrate Monero to my service? The eighth chapter will provide you all the answers for this question. From the JSON RPC to the OpenAlias sub project, everyone could start accepting Monero.
