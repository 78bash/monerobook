# Cryptography deep

Monero uses a wide variety of cryptographic primitives for various use cases.

Comparing to altcoins, Monero cryptography is considered conservative, sound and robust.

Comparing to Bitcoin, Monero uses much more primitives, and some of them are more advanced, especially those related to privacy and Proof of Work. Some choices are deliberately non-standard (for better or worse) - oftentimes a legacy of the CryptoNote protocol (for more information about the CryptoNote protocol, look for ninth chapter).  

In this part, we will talk about address generation, blockchain and privacy more in depth than in the first chapters.

## Monero Pseudorandom Number Generation

Monero uses PRNG based on the Keccak hashing function. Basically, output of the previous hashing round is input for the next one.

The initial seed comes from entropy sources provided by operating system. On Linux and MacOS the seed comes from /dev/urandom. On Windows the WinAPI CryptGenRandom call is used for seeding.

This concerns the reference C++ implementation of Monero. Please note there are many alternative implementations of private key generation, including JavaScript, Python, Android/Java. These should be researched case by case for correctness.

## Hashing

For generating addresses (especially public address), it's important to hash keys.

Monero employs Keccak as a hashing function. In most contexts specifically Keccak-256 is used, providing 32-byte hashes.

Choosing a good hashing algorithm is a must for creating addresses in a secure way: if it generates the same addresses, there will be a "collision" (two people will have the same seed, so same private and public keys).
