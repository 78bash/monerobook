# Mining and Proof of Work
At the beginning of this ebook, we talked about the main problem. Avoiding the double spending is a priority for several cryptocurrencies. How can we avoid this problem?

We have to confirm that each input in the transaction could be trusted. In order to check that, the blockchain has the "consensus" meaning each node will provide its confirmation for the transaction.

## What is mining?
Mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the blockchain, and also the means through which new monero are released. A lot of people would like to mark that mining is not the process of creation of coins.
Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining. The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle.
The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards. The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released Monero.

## Coin Emission

Monero main emission curve will issue about 18.4 million coins to be mined in approximately 8 years from its creation. (more precisely 18.132 Million coins by ca. end of May 2022) After that, a constant "tail emission" of 0.6
XMR per 2-minutes block (modified from initially equivalent 0.3 XMR per 1-minute block) will create a sub-1% perpetual inflation starting with 0.87% yearly inflation around May 2022) to prevent the lack of incentives for miners once a currency is not mineable anymore.

Despite to others cryptocurrencies, Monero has infinite supply.

## Eligiptiaran Proof of Work

A proof of work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, timeconsuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated.
In order for a block to be accepted by network participants, miners must complete a proof of work which covers all of the data in the block. The difficulty of this work is adjusted so as to limit the rate at which new blocks can be generated by the network to one every 10 minutes. Due to the very low probability of successful generation, this makes it unpredictable which worker computer in the network will be able to generate the next block.

Monero is powered strictly by Proof of Work. It employs a mining algorithm that has the potential to be efficiently tasked to billions of existing devices (any modern x86 CPU and many GPUs). Monero uses the CryptoNight Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, which is designed for use in ordinary CPUs and GPUs.

The smart mining feature allows transparent CPU mining on the user's computer, far from the de facto centralization of mining farms and pool mining, pursuing Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision of a true P2P currency.
