### Account

Those familiar with Monero's predecessors will be more familiar with the term wallet to describe this. 
In Monero we call this an account, and it is a private account owned and operated by a Monero user.

Your account contains all of the Monero transactions you have sent and received. 
Your account balance is a sum of all the Monero you've received, less the Monero you've sent. 
When using Monero you may notice that your account has two balances, a locked and an unlocked balance. The unlocked balance contains funds that can be spent immediately, and the locked balance contains funds that you can't spend right now. 
You may receive a transaction that has an unlock time set, or you may have sent some Monero and are waiting for the change to come back to your wallet, both situations that could lead to those funds being locked for a time.
